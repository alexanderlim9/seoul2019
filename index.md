## Thursday

# The wrong foot

The day started at 4am off to Logan and ended not in Seoul but in my bed back home in New York. Weather, connecting flights, and human error led me to miss my flight from JFK to Seoul and wow was I upset (at first). I spent along time on the phone (on hold) with customer service but I had a lot of really human moments over the 24 hours that I should’ve spent traveling overseas. 

# "My angel"

The first woman and I met while panicking about our shared predicament—we weren’t given the boarding pass for our connecting flight leaving in 30 minutes. She was a Korean woman, older than my mom but younger than my grandma, and she spoke little English. Two words stuck with me though as I helped carry her suitcase down the stairs: “my angel.” I ran frantically with her from agent to agent, I lent her my phone to call her daughter, I made sure to check that both of our bags would be on our flight out the next day. As we parted ways we said goodbye with a “see you tomorrow.” I didn’t see her the next day as I boarded, but I’m glad that we both missed our flight together.

# My own angel 
My own angel didn’t pick me up from the airport and I don’t blame her, who wants to navigate a car through JFK. My mom told me take an Uber home, but the conversation during the ride was well worth the traffic of getting out of Terminal 4. My mom told me when I sat down on the couch “I knew something was going to happen, I felt it.” But wow, am I glad it happened in New York where after the morning’s whirlwind and crying babies, I could have dumplings for lunch and sleep in my own bed. “Call Asiana! Put them on speakerphone. I will make gao ji while we wait.” She took the phone from my several times to, aggressively, May I speak to the manager, with customer service to get me back on track… and, of course, she did.

## Friday-Saturday

# Mix with rice
Grown up me wanted to say no when she offered to come to the airport with me, but I gave in and asked her to go with me. Finally, I board my flight and find my seat next to this elderly Korean woman. By the time the first meal came down the aisle we hadn’t exchanged any words with each other until I start to drink the soup on my tray. “Mix!” she instructs as she points to the bibimbap ingredients in front of me, “Mix with rice! She points to the gochugang sauce (more to mix) but then exchanges mine for the remainder of hers, throwing my unopened sauce into her purse. Later from another bag, my new friend brings out a bag of washed blueberries (MY FAVORITE BERRY) and offers me a handful. She helped me write Alexa’s address in Korean on my customs form and I watched her luggage while she went to the bathroom near baggage claim. Before leaving, she made sure that I knew where I was going and then I was off to the races. 

I did fall asleep on the bus to Jangan-dong where Alexa lives, but I was so sure that I didn’t sleep through my stop. BIG YIKES when I saw a missed call from Victoria and then these messages. But I made it in one piece!

## Sunday

# Tteokbokki!
Sunday was spent in Hongdae—mostly shopping, a big theme of the trip. We went to the New Balance flagship store with Victoria leading the way. The employees there were enamored by Alexa’s unreleased V5s and quite unironically pointed at her shoes and asked “What are those?!” even though I was the one wearing white vans. Those white vans made me extra nervous about the cup of tteokbokki that I was walking around with. I didn’t get any sauce on my shoes, but unfortunately I can’t say the same about my white t-shirt.

We went to the Raccoon Cafe which was pretty novel. The raccoons were pretty sleepy and so were the dogs but one of them took a liking to my lap. 

## Monday

# Trainspotting 
Starting off at the Noryangjin fish market was a little underwhelming, but Victoria and I stumbled upon this park with a view of the Han River. We were right by a major train route and bridge andI saw so many trains there including the KTX high speed trains! Next we made our way through the Namdaemun street market where I got dumplings. 

Next was Myeongdong where more shopping took place. We had bibimbap for lunch before jetlag sent us home early.

## Tuesday

# Beongeunsa temple
The Beongeunsa temple was really incredible to experience. I haven’t been to a Buddhist temple since I was in elementary school so it was special to visit one now, especially as I’ve started practicing these past few years.

# "What's Gangnam style"
Right across the street was the COEX Mall which was enormous and we immediately felt the business vibes of Gangnam walking among locals dressed exclusively in business formal. It was a great mall though. There were some great stores and this beautiful library area in the middle. 

While deciding what to wear for the day, I almost picked my new pink windbreaker but Alexa told me that that's not the right style for Gangam. The next sentence in the room was from Victoria, unforgettable and will never be nearly as appropriate as it was at the time: "What's Gangnam style?"

# Myeongdong at Night
We returned to Myeongdong in the evening to meet Alexa for soup dumplings Din Tai Fung. It took every bone in my body to not cave into the smorgasbord of street food that lines the streets at night. Din Tai Fung was a bit underwhelming (Victoria confirmed that this one wasn’t as good as some others) but the shrimp Xiao long bao were great and the red bean dessert ones were phenomenal. The dumplings were pretty small though so, much to my delight, there was plenty of room of the street food afterwards. 

## Wednesday

# The Palace
Wednesday was probably my favorite day of all. We took an easy morning and then left for Gyeongbokgung Palace just after noon. The palace was beautiful, and we arrive just in time for the changing of the guards. 

Nearby was the Bukchon Hanok village, a residential area where much of the traditional Korean architecture has been preserved. The neighborhood was really cute. I got a ho tteok and wow it was best thing I ate this whole trip.

# "Tea for deep sleep"
We met a lot of great people in Insadong afterwards. In a tea shop, this wonderful woman helped us choose teas, looking for the words to describe each one in English. In the complex down the street, I bought a bracelet from this cutest man who didn’t speak a lot of English but really tried his hardest. I wouldn’t have otherwise bought the bracelet but we laughed so much talking to him I was really sold on it. 

## Thursday

# View from the top
So far, we’d covered a lot of ground so we slowed down again on Thursday. The main event was going up to the N Seoul Tower, but we checked out the Dongdaemun Design Plaza first. We’d timed everything perfectly, we got to the Namsan Mountain cable car just before sunset and the views from the top were breathtaking albeit a little windy. From the top we watched the sun set over Seoul.

# Back home
Back at home we planned to do Korean barbecue and ran into Alexa’s boss Mr. Casey at the restaurant. The food was great and Mr. Casey even paid for our meal, a gesture for which we are very grateful. 

I broke out my switch and played Overcooked and Smash with Alexa. I think she beat me in every match we played, even when we were on the same team (whoops).

## Friday

# Welcome to the Blonde kids club
I’m entering my blonde phase today! I was both excited yet anxious about heading to Hongdae to the salon. I think I was more nervous about letting someone cut my hair than dyeing it blonde—no one has touched my hair in four years and I’ve been solely responsible for how good or bad my hair has looked. 

They were really nice, they offered me tea and gave me a magazine, but when I left the place my hair was straight up yellow. I looked in every mirror in the Uniqlo across the street and sent snaps to a few people before Alexa (a former blonde) convinced me to go back. So I went back and they toned my hair again to be less yellow and then I was happy. 

# "Spa"
My last solo bucket list item for Seoul was the “spa” that Kyle, my spiritual advisor, recommended from his trip to Seoul in January. I only learned earlier in the week that “spa” was more accurately translated to jimjilbang aka a Korean bathhouse. But I had made up my mind, Kyle said it was super relaxing, and I figured it would be a unique experience so totally foreign that I wouldn’t ever do back in the West. 

Thank god I read up about it before hand because there was almost no English signage once I got there and no one to explain why an older man (ajussi) would call me over to scrub the dead skin off my body while I’m naked. Okay, so it was only weird at the beginning but then not at all and I soaked in so many baths of various minerals and sat in salt and jade saunas. 

I got dressed again and got ready to leave before I realized I didn’t even explore the rest of the jimjilbang. I put on the sauna pajamas that they gave me and climbed the stairs to explore the rest of the facilities, I even got in a quick workout in the fitness room before I left. The whole experience was great and culturally fascinating. I went back home blonde, relaxed, and my skin feeling SO SOFT. 

# The Trashy Hongdae Experience™ 
Alexa insisted that no trip to Seoul would be complete without experiencing the club scene in Hongdae, specifically the club NB2 (NB stands for Noise Basement and I think that really gets to the essence of what a club is). On the taxi ride there I realized I forgot to bring my passport and was super bummed but all the places we went let me use my drivers license. One bouncer in particular just cheered “New Yoooooork” when he checked my ID. 

So we started with soju in the park before hopping around and landing in the trash heap that is NB2 and it was truly trashy but a ton of fun, very EDM. Then Alexa, Sam, Jackie, and I got in a taxi to Itaewon where the night ended with a gyro and a 4:30am taxi back home. A solid night.

## Saturday

# Hidden gem
Saturday started a bit later and I’m sure you can understand why. The three of us went to Itaewon for a Western brunch at a pancake house. We hung out around Itaewon until it got dark and hit the clubs again. There was this one club Moon Night that wasn’t busy at all but they had great music and a nice dance floor!

## Sunday

# Unlimited rice
Victoria led the way to the Filipino street market that opens on Sundays. She was really excited about it and I’m glad to have been able to experience it with her and try some of the authentic Filipino food. We sat down in a cantina where they served us a tray of (unlimited) rice, 2 entrees, and a dessert for 6,000won! The unlimited rice really hit me though when it came time for our last meal: fried chicken. 

# Unlimited rice aftermath
It was much more than enough food (especially after our lunch) but it was so good and I was shocked at much better it was with a beer. I’m not normally a beer person but wow what a combo. Alexa had me ask the waiter for a take out box in Korean so I end my trip with pojang hae do dweyo added to my vocabulary. 

## Monday

# Anyeongyi ke seo
I meant to write about my trip throughout the week but instead I’m looking back at it all from the plane. A great trip full of friends, special moments with strangers, new experiences, and some great food. It’s back to the East Coast now where it’s back to the parka and snow boots!
